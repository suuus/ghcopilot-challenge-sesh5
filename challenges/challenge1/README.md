# Challenge 1: Basic Documentation

## Task Description

You are working on a simple calculator library that needs proper documentation. Your task is to:

1. Add JSDoc comments to all functions in `calculator.js`
2. Create meaningful inline comments explaining complex logic
3. Add error handling documentation
4. Write examples of function usage
5. Create TypeScript type definitions

## Files to Work With

- `calculator.js`: Contains the calculator functions
- `calculator.test.js`: Tests to verify your documentation
- `calculator.d.ts`: TypeScript definitions file you need to create

## Success Criteria

1. All functions must have complete JSDoc documentation
2. Examples must be included for each function
3. Type definitions must be accurate
4. Tests must pass when run with `npm test`

## Tips

- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to ask about JSDoc formatting
- Try Copilot Edits to bulk-add documentation
- Make sure to document parameters and return types
- Include edge cases in your documentation

## Verification

Run the following command to verify your solution:
```bash
npm test challenge1
```
